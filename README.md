# C-Linked-List Que Implementation

Author: John Toledo
====================

This is a pure implmentation of a Que linked list developed in C
Compiled using windows and Linux environments with no issues.

To Test all the features/operations of a typical linked list,
I have added a menu that prompts the user for specified operation.

This will help you visually understand how a Que-linked list should function,
and reading through the source code may assist you in developing your very own

This version of a linked list only uses a head, but a tail can easily be added
